The code includes methods for reproducing the results, as well as general implementation of our parameter and functional estimation approaches. For an overview of the code and the methodology, see below.

# Abstract
- 
 
# Repository structure

| Folder | Description |
| ---- | ----------- | 
| `config` | Contains the config files for the different experiments. |
| `data` | Contains the scripts for downloading and generating data. |
| `evaluation` | Contains code for generating the plots. |
| `models` | Includes the different models and methods. |
| `scripts` | Contains utility scripts. |
| `utils` | Contains utility functions. |
| `main.py` | Main file to rund and evaluate experiments. |

# Setup

1. Clone project
1. In your shell run ```install.sh```. This will create the environment and install all relevant packages.

# Data

Scripts for downloading or generating the data automatically can be found in the data directory.

# Running the code

You can run a specific model by calling the script ```main.py```. You can use the existing config files or adjust them to your needs and then call ```main.py --config "config.ini"```. You can adjust the hyperparameters, training parameters, models and datasets. Calling the script will train the model and create an output folder with the performance metrics and other logging information.

## Reproduce results

You can reproduce experiments, by using the existing config files. Furthermore, you can set the ```only_validate``` flag in the config to evaluate an experiment using an already trained model. As the evaluation process is bound to a specific seed, this will reproduce the exact results from the main paper.
