# Setup

1. Install `Python` (see [here](https://python.org/)) and `R` (see [here](https://www.r-project.org/)).
	- `Python` is easiest installed by using the anaconda package manager (see [here](https://www.anaconda.com/)).
1. Clone project   
    - ```git clone https://github.com/cbuelt/spatio-temporal-extremes```
1. Install the `R` packages.
	- Source the file `utils/requirements.R`.
1. Install the python requirements.
    - Create a conda environment using ```conda env create -f utils/requirements.yml```
